## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components Created

#### 1. Analytics Service (`src/services/analyticsService.ts`)
**Purpose**: Core calculation engine for all performance metrics

**Key Calculations**:
- **Total Return**: Absolute and percentage gains/losses
- **Annualized Return**: Average yearly performance
- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of returns (risk measure)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted return metric
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Biggest peak-to-trough decline
- **Best/Worst Periods**: Top performing and worst performing days/months
- **Current Streaks**: Consecutive winning/losing periods

**Data Sources**:
- Portfolio transactions from existing API
- Current portfolio values from `portfolioService`
- Market data from existing `marketDataService`
- **No external APIs required** - uses only existing data

**Performance Features**:
- 5-minute intelligent caching
- Batch processing for multiple portfolios
- Incremental calculations for efficiency

#### 2. Enhanced API Endpoint (`src/app/api/performance/route.ts`)
**New Functionality**:
- `GET /api/performance?action=analytics` - Main analytics endpoint
- Support for portfolio-specific or dashboard-wide analytics
- Time period filtering (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 3Y, ALL)
- Currency conversion support
- Cache management endpoints for debugging

**Request Parameters**:
```
GET /api/performance?action=analytics&timeframe=1Y&currency=USD&portfolioId=optional
```

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalReturn": 15000,
    "totalReturnPercent": 12.5,
    "annualizedReturn": 8.2,
    "volatility": 18.5,
    "sharpeRatio": 1.2,
    "maxDrawdown": 15.3,
    "valueHistory": [...],
    "monthlyReturns": [...],
    // ... additional metrics
  },
  "metadata": {
    "calculationTime": "245ms",
    "timeframe": "1Y",
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

#### 3. React Query Integration (`src/hooks/usePortfolioData.ts`)
**New Hook**: `usePerformanceAnalytics(portfolioId?, timeframe, currency)`

**Features**:
- 5-minute stale time (analytics are expensive to calculate)
- 15-minute garbage collection time
- No auto-refetch on window focus (user-controlled)
- Error handling and retry logic
- Placeholder data during loading

### UI Components

#### 4. PerformanceChart Component (`src/components/PerformanceChart.tsx`)
**Dual Chart System**:
- **Portfolio Value Timeline**: Line chart showing value growth over time
- **Monthly Returns Bar Chart**: Green/red bars showing monthly performance

**Beginner-Friendly Features**:
- Chart type toggle (Value vs Returns)
- Custom tooltips with explanations
- Summary metrics below charts
- Help text explaining what each chart shows

**Technical Details**:
- Uses existing Recharts library
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Color-coded for easy understanding (green = good, red = bad)

#### 5. RiskMetrics Component (`src/components/RiskMetrics.tsx`)
**Visual Risk Dashboard**:
- **Volatility Gauge**: Traffic light system (Low/Medium/High risk)
- **Max Drawdown Gauge**: Shows biggest loss from peak
- **Sharpe Ratio Gauge**: Risk-adjusted return efficiency

**Beginner Explanations**:
- Plain English descriptions of each metric
- Contextual tooltips on hover
- Color-coded risk levels
- "What this means" explanations

**Risk Assessments**:
- Volatility: ≤15% = Low, ≤25% = Medium, >25% = High
- Sharpe Ratio: ≥1.5 = Excellent, ≥1.0 = Good, ≥0.5 = Fair
- Max Drawdown: ≤10% = Low risk, ≤20% = Medium, >20% = High

#### 6. PerformanceSummary Component (`src/components/PerformanceSummary.tsx`)
**Key Metrics Dashboard**:
- Overall performance assessment (Excellent/Good/Fair/Needs Attention)
- Total return and annualized return prominently displayed
- Best/worst day and month highlights
- Time period returns (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y)
- Current winning/losing streaks

**Performance Assessment Logic**:
- ≥15% annualized = "Excellent"
- ≥10% annualized = "Very Good"
- ≥5% annualized = "Good"
- ≥0% annualized = "Fair"
- <0% annualized = "Needs Attention"

### Integration with Main Dashboard

#### 7. Dashboard Integration (`src/app/page.tsx`)
**Seamless Integration**:
- Added after existing allocation charts, before holdings table
- Toggle button to show/hide analytics (reduces cognitive load)
- Time period selector (1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, 3Y, All Time)
- Refresh button following existing pattern
- Loading states and error handling

**User Experience**:
- Analytics hidden by default to avoid overwhelming users
- Clear "Show Analytics" button to opt-in
- Responsive layout adapts to screen size
- Beginner tips section with personalized insights

## 🎯 Beginner-Friendly Design Philosophy

### Plain English Approach
Instead of complex financial jargon, we use simple language:
- "Total Profit" instead of "Total Return"
- "How much your investments bounce around" instead of "Volatility"
- "Return per dollar of risk" instead of "Sharpe Ratio"
- "Biggest drop from peak" instead of "Maximum Drawdown"

### Visual Learning
- **Color Coding**: Consistent green (good) / red (bad) / blue (neutral)
- **Gauges and Progress Bars**: Visual risk level indicators
- **Charts with Context**: Explanatory text below each chart
- **Traffic Light System**: Low/Medium/High risk categories

### Contextual Help
- Hover tooltips on all metrics
- "What this means" explanations in plain English
- Personalized insights based on actual portfolio performance
- Actionable advice (e.g., "Consider reviewing risk vs return")

### Progressive Disclosure
- Analytics hidden by default
- Users choose when to view detailed metrics
- Simple summary cards lead to detailed explanations
- Optional technical details for advanced users
